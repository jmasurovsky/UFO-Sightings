# UFO-Sightings

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a website with an interactive table using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS about UFO sightings that allow the user to use multiple filters to search through the data itself.  

## Results

To use the website, Dana, for example, should navigate to the home link: https://jmasurovsky.github.io/UFO-Sightings/. Dana should begin reading the description on the main page to understand the context of UFO sightings. Then, scroll down and the UFO sighting data is presented as a table with multiple filters such as, '''. To use the filters, Dana has to type in the filter she wants to sort the data by typing in the filter box. For example, the image below shows filtering by "ca" (california) state and "triangle" shape.

## Summary

A drawback of the interactive table is the user must type in the filter to retrieve specific information, when using a drop-down menu would be easier for the user's experience. One recommendation would be to add a "Duration" filter so the data can be searched by the duration of the UFO sighting. A second recommendation would be to use google maps api to map the UFO sightings by city.
